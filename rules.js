                <p>Think of Polish grammar like <strong>arranging furniture in a room.</strong> Here is how it works with the year included:</p>

                <div class="analogy-box" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--text-dim); background: rgba(0,0,0,0.02); margin-bottom: 10px;">
                     <h4>🪧 The Signpost (Day of the Week)</h4>
                     <p>The day name (like <em>Wtorek</em> or <em>Sobota</em>) is just the signpost at the end of the driveway. It always stays in its basic name form (Nominative) because it's just a label.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analogy-box" style="background: rgba(128,128,128,0.05); border-left: 4px solid #666; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    <h4>🏗️ The Building (The Year)</h4>
                    <p>The <strong>Year (${currentYear})</strong> is the building. It never moves. Because everything happens "of that year," it is always locked in the possessive case: <strong>${currentYear} roku</strong>.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analogy-box" style="border-left: 4px solid #ffd700; padding: 15px; background: rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.05);">
                    <h4>🎉 Mode: (It's on...) — The Event</h4>
                    <p>You are actually <strong>using</strong> the room for a party. Because an action is happening "on" the day, the <strong>Day</strong> furniture shifts to the Genitive to match the room.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> <em>Dziesiątego ${dynamicMonth}...</em></p>

            <p>In Poland, <strong>Name Days</strong> are often more important than birthdays. Most Polish calendars list the names associated with each day.</p>

        <h1>Grammar Rules</h1>
        <div class="content-body">
            <h2>1. Ordinal Numbers</h2>
            <p>Polish dates always use <strong>Ordinal Numbers</strong> (1st, 2nd, etc.). You don't say "one January," you say "the first of January."</p>
            
            <h2>2. Written vs. Spoken (Cases)</h2>
            <p><strong>Written (Genitive):</strong> The standard way to write dates or talk about appointments. <em>"On the 5th of January"</em> uses the Genitive case.</p>
            <p><strong>Spoken (Nominative):</strong> Used for simple statements, like answering <em>"What day is it today?"</em></p>
